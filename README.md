![Data Club Project I (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126924616/222856535-e529bd49-d42e-441a-b2b0-55fa04b7207b.jpg)
## Project Description
This project is dedicated to data engineering students. The main idea is to provide you as a future data engineer with basic knowledge about databases and the process that the data get throw so we can use it to extract or extrapolate insights from it.


In this project, we will be working on DVD rental data representing the business processes of a DVD rental store. The data has been collected in CSV files and your job as a data engineer is to build and maintain the data system for the company so they can store it and do an analysis on it. So, we will develop a data warehouse that allows us to analyze data from a DVD rental store. We will start by creating a conceptual data model (CDM) and an entity-relationship (ER) model to represent the key entities and relationships in our rental data. We will then design and implement a relational database management system (RDBMS) using SQL to store our data. 


Once we have our database in place, we will write an ETL (extract, transform, load) job to populate it with sample data. We will also explore the concept of data warehousing and design a star schema to optimize our data for analysis. 


Finally, we will create interactive dashboards using popular data visualization tools to analyze our rental data. Along the way, we will practice time management and develop teamwork skills by working collaboratively in a small group. 

+ <b>What you will learn during this project:</b>
  - Time management
  - Developing Teamwork skills
  - Data modeling ( CDM model, ER model )
  - Relational database management systems
  - SQL queries
  - Write ETL job
  - Data warehousing concept ( star schema )
  - Dashboarding & data analysis ( techniques, tools )
  
  
I hope you will find it inspiring and useful.
